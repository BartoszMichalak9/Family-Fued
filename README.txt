Overview:

Upon start up of the program, the user must click "Start" to launch the program. 
After the program has launched, the user must type in the IP address of the server and click "Ready".
After four players have clicked "Ready", the question will appear on all of the clients. After all of the
answers have been correctly answered, the players will be asked to click "Ready" again. After four players have
clicked "Ready" again another round will spawn. After each round, the scores for each player are updated in the top
right hand corner. There are five rounds with one question per round.


Questions and Answers:

Each round stats with the first person to connect as the first person to answer the question for that round.
When a user answers a question correctly, their answer button is unlocked so that they can answer another question.
However, if they answered the question incorrectly their button will lock and the next client who connected after the current client
will have their submit answer button unlocked.
